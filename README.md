**PolyEngine** is a custom FNF engine made for modding & playing. It includes nice additions like week 7, mp4 support and cache cleaning.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **engine**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

# Features

 - **Downscroll and input**
	 - An improved input system, similar to osu!, with less delays, downscroll, and more!
 - **Keybinding (EXPERIMENTAL)**
	 - Now you can switch between WASD and DFJK, or custom keys!
 - **Polymod support**
     - ^ read it.
 - **Video support**
	 - An experimental media support of MP4 files. (ONLY WINDOWS AND HTML5)
 - **Note offset** (in beta)
	 - Change the offset of the notes. It's useful if you have a Bluetooth speaker / headphones.
